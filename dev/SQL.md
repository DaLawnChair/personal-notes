```sql
--- basics selectors
select <name> -- slected information for output table

from <tableName> -- imports a table

(INNER) JOIN <table> -- Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN <table> -- Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN <table> -- Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table DO NOT USE THIS OFTEN
FULL (OUTER) JOIN <table> -- Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
CROSS JOIN <table> -- returns a table with all possible permuations of rows from each table

ON <condition> -- select where to join tables on
where <condition> -- select conditions to select
having <condition> -- 
group by <param> -- group the rows by the given param
```

```sql 
--- Operators
AND -- has both conditions
OR -- has either conditions
NOT, IS NOT -- doesn't have the condition
ANY -- TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the condition	
EXISTS -- TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records
IN -- TRUE if the operand is equal to one of a list of expressions
LIKE -- TRUE if the operand matches a pattern (good for regex)
SOME -- TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the condition

=,>,>=,<,<= -- self explanatory
<> -- not equals to
```


```
--- Common functions
COUNT(<param>) --- counts the occurances of the given param
COUNT(DISTINCT <param>) --- counts the distinct occurances of a given param
COUNT(*) --- counts the occurances of rows of all the same param values

SUM(<numerical_param>) --- sums over a numerical param

AVG(<numerical_param>) --- averages over a numerical param
--- specifically you can pass a boolean value inside of here to get the % of values that are True/False

COALESCE(<value_list>) --- returns the first non-Null value. Usefull for finding if a value exists or defaulting to a value. 
```

```
-- classes
Date -- used for denoting dates
DATEDIFF(<date1>,<date2>) -- returns the differences between dates
to_char(<date>, 'YYYY-MM--DD') --- get the Year-month-date of a date object



VarChar -- representation of strings
LENGTH(<varchar>) -- get length of string

--- enum

```

Integer divison leads to integer, can solve by typecasting the numerator
	ie top::decimal / bottom or top::numerical / bottom

This is a repo for having fun and learning how to solve fairly hard problems :)
# Mathematics

What do I actually want to achieve?

I want to get a better understanding of how programs function, find better ways to debug problems than just print statements, and solve problems that require a lot of thinking. ML work is difficult to truly evaluate if something is working properly versus what is actually happening. Thus understanding the code and how it works and being able to trace it will greatly help me converge to simplier solutions that just work with less hours looking for bugs. (ideally)

# Don't hit the books too much
Generally you should be spending >5% of your time reading solutions and guides or watching videos. This topic inheritenly calls for a lot of active practice and mental exhaustion of most basic concepts and then some advanced ones.

It is very easy to read too advanced topic and lose focus on simplier solutions
# Websites to study:
* Geeks for geeks algorithms: generally has a lot of the most common algorithms there
* Leetcode: many toy example problems that will be useful in algorithmic application and program transformation, not so much so for algorithm development
	* do have leetcode premium until October though, so make use of it!
	* leetcode hosts weekly/biweekly contests that are also good!
* Hacker rank: same platform that a lot of companies use, I guess this makes it better for interviews but it is still hard and gets similar gears running
* a2oj.com
	* a currated list of problems that can be, but most don't, use for a kind of roadmap
